Features to implement next:

1. Open a file from the system. Show it locally.

2. Send the entire file over a connection (as a single DataPacket)
    - Later: consider sending it as multiple packets

3. Open multiple files (open on both sides of the connection), and edit between the two seamlessly.

4. Open multiple files (but don't force them to be open), and edit between the two seamlessly.
