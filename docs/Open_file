Sequence for opening a new file:
    - Opening a file in one window will cause the other window to open it as well.
        - Both windows will force users to have the same tabs open at all times, for now.

1. Open file, read contents into tab
2. Take contents, put into datapacket
3. broadcast datapacket with type FILE_CONTENTS
    - the filename will be in metadata

4. Add routing rule for FILE_CONTENTS
    - if file already open, get tab and overrite all contents
    - if file not open, new tab with that name, and all the contents.
