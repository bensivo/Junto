TODO:

For now:
- Implement a DataPacket router.
- Get rid of Operation-specific logic in the Network Manager,
- Write a superclass for Server and Client. Both have the ability to broadcast and receive packets.
- Figure out why the program doesn't actually stop on close.
    - Note: it stops correctly if you never opened any connections. It's probably the Connection Pooler Threads and the DataPackerReceiver Threads

Later:
- Implement An incoming OperationQueue at the Dispatcher level.
    - Each listener socket will push to the Operation dispatcher
- Have the dispatcher handle one operation at a time.


Things to think about:
- Do we need to store the state of a file that isn't open?
    - Store state of unopened files...
        or
    - Get Entire file when requested (probably)

- Really only one outgoing OPeration can be sent at a time. We don't really need to worry about outgoing Operation pools, right?
